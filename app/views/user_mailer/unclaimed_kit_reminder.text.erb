<%= @user.full_name %>,

We sent a specimen collection kit to you recently
(<%= @study_participant.kit_last_sent_at %>), but you have not
yet claimed it.

When it arrives -- or right now, if you have already
received it -- please claim it here:

  <%= study_claim_kit_url %>

If you never receive the kit, don't worry; we will
send you another kit when resources permit.


Many thanks,

Personal Genome Project Staff
