Dear <%= @user.full_name %>,

New data files and preliminary analysis results have been attached to
your personal profile, and are available for you to review before
publication:

  <%= raw @dataset.name %>

<%= render :partial => "dataset_preamble_for_#{@dataset.data_type.sub(' ','_')}" rescue nil %>

As described in the Informed Consent, your data and the associated
report will *by default* be released to the PGP's public website and
database within 30 days unless you notify us before then that you are
choosing to withdraw from the study. If you choose to withdraw from
the study, your data will not be published by the PGP.

If you do not withdraw within 30 days and your data and associated
report are published, they will be associated with your public
participant profile. The publication of this data will help further
the PGP mission of finding new ways to connect human genetic
information with trait information to promote scientific
research. Your data may also be automatically updated by the PGP from
time to time. You will *not* be notified in advance or asked to
consent to any such future updates by the PGP.
