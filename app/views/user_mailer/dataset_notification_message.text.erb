Dear <%= @user.full_name %>,

As part of our process for releasing genomes publicly, we provide each
participant with their genomic data and a preliminary genome analysis
prior to publication, as described in Section 5.4 and Section 5.5 of
the Consent for Participation: http://www.personalgenomes.org/consent/

Your raw genomic data and preliminary genome analysis are now
available for you to review. It is important that you remember that
both the data and the analysis are intended for research use only. The
generation of genomic data is not an error-free process and our genome
analysis system is still under development. Because the body of
knowledge of genetic variants has many uncertainties, we cannot
guarantee that your analysis is either accurate or complete.

Your genomic data and preliminary analysis almost certainly contain
meaningful errors and mistakes, such as:

* Variants which are actually benign (not harmful) are reported as
  pathogenic (harmful).

* Variants which are actually pathogenic (harmful) are reported as
  benign (not harmful).

* Variants which are pathogenic (harmful) are not reported at all.

Mix-ups are also possible and this means that the genomic data we
return to you might be derived from or contaminated by another
person’s specimens. For a more detailed summary of potential risks
related to participation in the PGP, you may wish to review Section 6
of the Consent for Participation:

  http://www.personalgenomes.org/consent/

YOU SHOULD NOT USE EITHER YOUR GENOMIC DATA OR YOUR GENOME ANALYSIS
REPORT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL ADVICE, DIAGNOSIS OR
TREATMENT. IF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT ANY ASPECT OF YOUR DATA OR
REPORT YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH A LICENSED HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL.

In the event that your genome data and preliminary analysis contain
variants predicted to have effects on your health that you find
concerning, the National Center for Biotechnology Information supports
a voluntary listing of US and international genetics clinics providing
genetic evaluation and genetic counseling:

As described in the Informed Consent, your genomic data and the
associated report will *by default* be released to the PGP's public
website and database within 30 days unless you notify us before then
that you are choosing to withdraw from the study. If you choose to
withdraw from the study your genomic data will not be published by the
PGP.

If you do not withdraw within 30 days and your genome and associated
report are published, they will be associated with your public
participant profile. The publication of this data will help further
the PGP mission of finding new ways to connect human genetic
information with trait information to promote scientific
research. Your data may also be automatically updated by the PGP from
time to time, although you will not be notified in advance or asked to
consent to any such future updates by the PGP.
